### Population count

Write a function which takes a non-negative integer and returns the number of “1” bits set
in the binary representation of that integer. 

For example, 5 is 101 in binary, so

* population_count(5) = 2

Here are some other examples:

* population_count(0) = 0
* population_count(8) = 1
* population_count(15) = 4
* population_count(19) = 3

Your finished program should include both your population_count function and code to check each of
these examples and print the results.

The input will always be a non negative integer less than 1000000 — we don’t care how your program
behaves faced with other inputs. 

Don’t worry about programming defensively here, but we do care somewhat about elegance— it’s better to write less code than more!
